## About Me
Having graduated from a university as a software engineer I've never been working in IT.

The reason is my hobby. It's speedcubing (solving Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles). I compete at competitions, and teach children to solve puzzles. Also I am a WCA Delegate what means that I am a main judge at competitions. And I help organizers before and during competitions. After each competition I have to write a report in English. It turned out a great tool for improving my writing skills.

Now I've joined the JavaScript FrontEnd course in the Rolling Scope School. I would like to get new knowledge to have more options for my career.
